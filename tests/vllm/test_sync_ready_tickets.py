"""Tests for ``scripts/vllm/sync_ready_tickets.py``.

We isolate the script from disk + GitHub by:

    * Pointing ``RESULTS_DIR``, ``OUT`` and ``STATE`` at tmp_path.
    * Seeding synthetic AMD nightly JSONL files across dates so the history
      aggregator has real input.
    * Never supplying ``PROJECTS_TOKEN`` so the ``live`` branch never fires.
      The live branch talks to GitHub GraphQL and REST — we exercise it
      indirectly via the dry-run plan instead. Integration against the real
      projects API is not something unit tests should do.

The tests focus on the *logic* the team lead pushed back on:
    - canonical title format is locked to upstream's ``[CI Failure]: <agent>: <test>``
      convention — the exact string vllm-project engineers grep for on board #39
    - hardware prefix is PRESERVED so each (agent, test) pair gets its own
      ticket (matching how the board is already populated by hand)
    - summary metrics (first failure, streak start, last success, break count)
      match what a human would draw from a timeline
    - plan JSON only contains currently-failing groups
    - dry-run writes a plan WITHOUT touching the network even if PROJECTS_TOKEN
      is set to garbage (we still force dry-run via READY_TICKETS_LIVE unset)
