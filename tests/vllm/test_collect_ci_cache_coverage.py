"""Regression tests for the cache-coverage check in collect_ci.py.

The AMD nightly build can flip to ``state="passed"`` while one or more
``soft_fail: true`` jobs are still running — the build doesn't wait on
soft-fail jobs to block completion. Concrete incident that motivated this:

    build 7791, job "mi250_1: Basic Models Tests (Other)":
        state=timed_out  soft_failed=true  retries_count=2
        started 12:30 UTC, finished 15:31 UTC (timeout at 3h)

    The previous collector pass ran at ~04:46 UTC (before the job even
    started). It wrote a partial jsonl without this job. When the next
    collector pass eventually ran (with build now state=passed), the old
    cache-skip logic saw ``date in existing_dates and state in
    TERMINAL_STATES`` and skipped. Result: the timed-out job was
    permanently missing, parity_report.json recorded ``amd=None`` for
    ``basic models tests (other)``, and the dashboard's "Failing Tests"
    filter (which requires ``g.amd.failed > 0``) dropped the group
    from the count — 9 shown, 10 actually soft-failed on Buildkite.

These tests exercise the ``_cache_covers_all_jobs`` / ``_cached_job_names``
helpers directly, without hitting Buildkite. The rule being locked in:
for the newest nightly, *cache-skip is only valid if every test job currently
visible in the build has at least one record in the cached jsonl*. Historical
cached builds are trusted; re-fetching old complete Buildkite logs is slow and
can rate-limit hard enough to block publication of the latest snapshot.
