"""Regression tests for the PR/issue boundary in ``scripts/collect.py``.

The ``/search/issues`` endpoint returns both PRs and issues — even with
``is:pr`` in the query, a result occasionally slips through as a plain
issue (type mixing in the API shape, stale cache, rate-limit reshape).
If a plain issue leaks into ``fetch_prs()``, it pollutes ``prs.json``
with an issue that the dashboard then renders in the PR table — wrong
URL, no merge state, nonsensical draft flag.

These tests feed realistic GitHub payloads into the two collectors and
assert the boundary holds: PRs go to the PR sink, issues to the issue
sink, and mixed responses are filtered correctly. The payload shapes
below were captured from real ``gh api`` responses against
``vllm-project/vllm`` so they match the production schema (``html_url``
format, ``pull_request`` key presence/absence, nested ``labels``).
